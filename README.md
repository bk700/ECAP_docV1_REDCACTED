### ECAP_docV1

I brought the idea of this application for sharing results with the lab.  This is the first interactive version after the idea was greenlit.  Since the finished application may contain data and experiment information that is currently being worked on, until I have a response from the lab supervisor I only feel comfortable sharing this older version with data that isn't vital to the publication.  Overall, the final version is mostly the same, the other pages besides graphing were finished and more information regarding the variables of the experiment being viewed were added.
